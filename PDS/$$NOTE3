Here is a sequence of emails concerning changes to DSAT.

The email reporting is backwards:  from solution to problem.

What's going on here?  Explanation:

John Loch wanted to incorporate SMS changes from EDS/HP into the
 CBT-distributed version of DSAT.  John L also noticed that DSAT
 does not assemble cleanly under z/OS 1.11 (also 1.10) and that
 the CAMLST BLOCK code is the culprit.  What to do?

Dan Dalby was brought in as the "knowledgeable consultant" and
 Dan pointed out that if you don't have CVOLs, you don't need the
 CAMLST BLOCK code.  Dan suggested that you dummy out the expansion
 of the CAMLST BLOCK macros by substituting DC  4F'0' instead.

Sam Golob pointed out that it doesn't hurt to include the expanded
 CAMLST BLOCK code in the load module, instead of Dan's dummy
 DC  4F'0' suggestion to substitute for it.  This is because if a
 CVOL might happen to exist, and if the level of the system still
 actually supports them, then DSAT won't blow up, and DSAT might
 actually still work.  Dan agreed with that.  It is a safety net.

Sam Golob took the assembly/link JCL out of the DSAT source code.
 Assembly of DSAT is now in member DSAT$.

The "real emails" follow.

Yes, Sam's method certainly is a better choice for those that
might want to TRY to use CVOLs.  It's not an MVS level problem.
CVOLs only contain dates up to 99.365.

The MVS 3.8 enthusiasts may always run with a system date prior
to 2000 as other MVS 3.8 code would break as well.

Good luck.
Dan Dalby

 Hi John et al,

 Dan Dalby came up with the idea of substituting DC  4F'0' for
 the CAMLST BLOCK lines where the macro was actually coded.

 The reason why IBM eliminated the BLOCK parameter from the
 CAMLST macro in z/OS 1.10 is that it is for CVOLs and CVOLs are
 no longer supported.

 I don't think that the MVS 3.8 enthusiasts will use your
 version of DSAT anyway, because they don't have SMS.

 Dan's change is at the bottom.

 However, since CVOLs might still be there (although not
 supported), maybe my change is better to put in, rather than
 Dan's:  My change came from a z/OS 1.9 assembly of DSAT, where
 the expanded CAMLST BLOCK code lines are substituted for the
 macro call.

 Here are the changes that Dan himself made...

 *TTRLOC  CAMLST BLOCK,0,0,0
 TTRLOC   DC    4F'0'                                               #DD

 *LOCBYTTR CAMLST BLOCK,0,0,0           LOCATE BY TTR
 LOCBYTTR DC    4F'0'                   LOCATE BY TTR               #DD

 Also, as I hate any type of warning or error message, I added
 "NOUSING" to the PARM= for ASMA90.  Now I get RC=0 for this job.

 When I call DSAT it works perfectly.  As my catalog is not
 SYSCTLG....  the BLOCK code never gets called.

Subject:   DSAT command

We shared a few emails discussing DSAT and was wondering if you
could help.

I attached a copy of DSAT that included a new NOSMS/SMS option
and asked if you would be willing to incorporate our changes into
the base DSAT module and then supply that to Sam Golob for
inclusion to the CBT tape.  I ask because as DSAT has changed
over the years, I'm not sure if all the changes for DSAT have
been incorporated into the EDS version of DSAT.  I'm not a strong
assembler programmer so if the fate of the world relied on me
making that determination, re-writing it and sending it to Sam;
we may be waiting a long time.

I also have another issue I need help with.  DSAT will not
re-assemble under z/OS 1.11 because of some functionality being
dropped in the CAMLST macro.

In the comments of CAMLST macro for z/OS 1.11 it states:

*/*     - The first parameter indicates the function requested and   */
*/*       is required for all CAMLST invocations. For Catalog, the   */
*/*       supported functions are NAME, CAT, CATBX, UNCAT, UCATDX    */
*/*       and RECAT. For DADSM, the supported functions are SEARCH,  */
*/*       SEEK, SCRATCH and RENAME. Functions no longer supported    */
*/*       are BLDA, BLDG, BLDX, BLOCK, DLTA, DLTX, DRPX, and LNKX.   */

DSAT is currently using the BLOCK function, which is generating
the errors.  I attached a copy of the output, if you would like
to see.

So I guess, my real question is.  "Would you be willing to
incorporate the SMS code into DSAT and fix DSAT so that it
assembles under z/OS 1.11?"  If not, would you be able to
recommend a contact.

John,

Andreas Freybier was the last person to change DSAT in April
2003, so he may be able to help out.  I think the CAMLST BLOCK
and LOCBYTTR code can be removed.  My DFP 1.9 manual says the
CAMLIST BLOCK format is no longer supported and will result in an
error, but it assembles OK.

Hello John,

Yes, some years ago I did some small enhancements to the DSAT
listlines.  Now I tried an assembly with z/OS 1.10 and have the
same assembly errors.

But our old load module is still working with 1.10.

I think we should discuss with Sam, if the DSAT can/should be
adapted for the new CAMLST and for future EAV etc.

Best Regards,
Andreas
