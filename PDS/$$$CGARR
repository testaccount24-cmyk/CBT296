Hello Sam,
After installing DVOL from file 296 of V468 in z/OS V1R6, I
started experiencing S0C1 abends when I used DVOL.  I discovered
that the CVAFDSM parameter list length has changed from 64 to 100
bytes somewhere between V1R4 and V1R6.  This caused a mismatch
with the ICVAFPL macro unless CVPLX=YES is added to the macro
(ICVAFPL DSECT=NO,CVPLX=YES).  In my case, this extra 34 bytes
caused IXTOFMT5 to overlay the 1st savearea whenever the CVAFDSM
parameter list was moved to the workarea in preparation of a
CVAFDSM request.  Thus, the S0C1 everytime DVOL terminated.  I
have attached my version of DVOL to correct this and try to keep
it from happening again in case CVAFDSM is modified in the
future.

As a side note, I have doing this job for 30 years and will be
retiring soon.  I want to thank you for the great work with CBT
and the helpful articles.  You and the contributors to CBT have
been a immense help during my career.

Thanks,
