I added a small test to see if a file is an HFS dataset. Of
course there is a question of whether an HFS dataset is a
partitioned dataset or not so you can adjust the code accordingly
to the answer to that question (i.e. how you want the flags set).
This change does avoid the S213-8C abend if one attempts to do a
DSAT dsname FULL  against an HFS dataset. I marked the change
lines with @KLS0710. I did not add DS1PDSEX to the FORMAT 1 DSCB
DSECT you have in program so you might want to make that
additional change.  (Note from SBG - I did make the change, but
that code is not used.  The real code is from macro IECSDSL1 (1)
to describe a Format 1 DSCB.  So the current version of that macro
- in SYS1.MODGEN - is where the Format 1 fields are generated from.)
