Hi Sam,

Attached is a new version of the COMPARE member of CBT file 296.

This version has a small change to the COMPARE command processor
such that it will pass a control statement of
 COMPARE TYPORG=PO
instead of the usual
 COMPARE TYPORG=PS
to IEBCOMPR/ZEBCOMPR if the DSORG is PO and no member name is
specified.

This change will stop IEBCOMPR getting I/O errors when trying to
process PDS directories as sequential files using the DCB
attributes from the VTOC entry, and will allow it to perform
comparisons of the actual data of each member as well as the user
data of the directory entries.

Note that the COMPARE command processor (but not the COMPAREB
program) is reentrant, so I have also changed the assemble and
link edit parameters accordingly.

Cheers,
Greg
