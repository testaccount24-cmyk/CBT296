Hi Andreas,

After a day in the debugger, I discovered that the loop (when no
name-list index is used, so DSAT uses the prefix or userid) was caused
by R10 not being restored because of the 2 jumps to GETLEN and MOVEREST
below.

To fix the problem, I added the base register code again after the
LOCATE label.  And I added a missing "L R10,BASER3" in the "GET
ALLOCATION" section.

Attached is updated source.

Regards,
John K

Hello Sam

everyone's satisfaction <<<
Yes, I think that will be good.
I'll keep you in cc:

Hi Andreas,

     It is always a pleasure to talk to you, and it is nice for me to
have an excuse to write.  (Keep fixing things.  Then we can talk a lot.
Like I do to John.)

     I guess from John's feedback that I should wait in updating the CBT
Tape, until both John and you are satisfied that this code works
properly.  The world was doing without this until now, and they can wait
a couple of days more, until everything is fixed to everyone's
satisfaction.  Of course, please let me know how things are going.

     All the best of everything to you and your family.

Sincerely,    Sam
