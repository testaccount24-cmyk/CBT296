Sam,

Can You Update RELEASE on File 296 and 035?  I have a working
version of RELEASE in UTILXMIT member of file 182.

Regards,
John K

Note from Sam G.: There are assembly options in the RELEASE command
                  that are needed if SWA was above the 16M line, or
                  not.  These are what were changed in the source code
                  for the RELEASE command.
